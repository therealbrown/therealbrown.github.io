      <p>
        Phil studied at Georgetown University, where he excelled at avoiding doing any meaningful work for four years. In 2009, Phil managed to convice the institution to give him a degree. Following his education, Phil miraculously tricked a company into hiring him called ARPC. Due to a clerical error, he was runniong an entire practice at ARPC in three years time. He now lives in Evanston in an apartment that's too expensive and attends Kellogg School of Management, a top 6 business school.
